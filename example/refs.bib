  abstract = {Apparatus which permits accurate measurement of shear stress and ``exit pressure'' has been constructed by the authors. Data has been obtained for high density polyethylene and polypropylene and the primary normal stress difference has been calculated by revising an equation advanced by Metzner et al. Measurements were obtained using capillaries of various L/D ratios inasmuch as there is evidence to indicate that elastic properties require a considerable flow distance to fully develop. Furthermore, the ``exit pressure'' has been correlated with the melt die swell which is known to depend on the L/D ratio. In addition to to the experiments with polymer melts, studies were also performed with a Newtonian fluid (Indopol H-1900) which, at room temperature, has a viscosity comparable to that of a polymer melt. These experiments demonstrated that the technique gives a zero (gauge) ``exit pressure'' for a Newtonian fluid. Finally, a special die was used to test Lodge's ``Hole Pressure'' hypothesis inasmuch as the existence of this effect would considerably influence the results. Experiments were performed using polyethylene, polypropylene, and Indopol H-1900. In no case was the ``Hole Pressure'' effect observed.},

  abstract = {The flow of polyethylene from a reservoir into a capillary has been studied visually using a new technique for observing the flow patterns. Various patterns observed with different polyethylenes are shown, both below and above the critical shearing stress at which the extrudate becomes distorted. The technique is readily adaptable to observe directly the elastic energy stored in the melt above the capillary entrance and the rate at which this energy can be dissipated on the cessation of the steady flow into the capillary.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are under intense investigation in materials science owing to their potential for modifying the electrical conductivity {$\sigma$}, shear viscosity {$\eta$}, and other transport properties of polymeric materials. These particles are hybrids of filler and nanoscale additives because their lengths are macroscopic whereas their cross-sectional dimensions are closer to molecular scales. The combination of extended shape, rigidity and deformability allows CNTs to be mechanically dispersed in polymer matrices in the form of disordered 'jammed' network structures. Our measurements on representative network-forming multiwall nanotube (MWNT) dispersions in polypropylene indicate that these materials exhibit extraordinary flow-induced property changes. Specifically, {$\sigma$} and {$\eta$} both decrease strongly with increasing shear rate, and these nanocomposites exhibit impressively large and negative normal stress differences, a rarely reported phenomenon in soft condensed matter. We illustrate the practical implications of these nonlinear transport properties by showing that MWNTs eliminate die swell in our nanocomposites, an effect crucial for their processing.},

  abstract = {A well-known Phan-Thien and Tanner differential viscoelastic constitutive equation has been employed to analyze the nonlinear stability and dynamics of nonisothermal film casting. A finite element method combined with stabilization techniques including discrete elastic viscous stress splitting and the streamline upwind Petrov--Galerkin method was first performed for the numerical calculation of transient film casting. Therefore, the stability analysis of film casting was carried out based on a wider parameter space of processing and the rheological properties of the polymer melt, during which the critical draw ratio for the occurrence of draw resonance (Drc) was taken as an indicator for flow stability. Unlike the results predicted by the upper-convected Maxwell model, the stabilizing region upon an upper critical draw ratio is nonexistent, while more than one peak of Drc was observed with varying aspect ratios, which was dominated by two deformation types named planar and transitional deformations, respectively. Our simulation results show that elongational rheological behavior plays a dominant role in the stability of flow for both extensional-thickening and extensional-thinning fluids, while the effects of processing parameters such as extrusion rate and cooling and rheological parameters such as relaxation time on Drc all can be attributed to elongational viscosity.},
